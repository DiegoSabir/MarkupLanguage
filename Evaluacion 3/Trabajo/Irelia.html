		<h2>Biography</h2>
		<p>
			The Noxus invasion of Ionia produced many heroes, but none were more unlikely than the young Irelia of Navori. 
			Trained in the ancient dances of her region, she adapted her art for warfare and now uses her refined and graceful movements to control an arsenal of deadly blades. 
			After proving herself to be a warrior, she was assigned the role of leader and example of the resistance. Today, she remains dedicated to defending her territory.
